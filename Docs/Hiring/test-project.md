# Test iOS project

## Introduction

The main purpose of this test project is to check your basic skills in developing a client-server app for iOS. If you already have some experience working on a similar project (the one that requires server interactions, and caching, and matches the requirements below), feel free to share the link to your project on GitHub instead.

## Main requirements

### technology

* programming language â€” Swift
* project published on GitHub
* use any open-source API as the data source (you can pick one [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) or [here](https://github.com/surfstudio/iOSSpringSchool2020/blob/master/practice.md))

### implementation

* your app has to contain at least 2 screens: (1) a list of objects, (2) a detailed view of an object
* your app has to receive objects from an open API (REST architecture only)
* your app has to function offline
* uploading and data processing operations have to run in the background thread

### we recommend:
* taking a look at the materials in our [repository](https://github.com/surfstudio/Surf-iOS-Developers)
* using system components and libraries to their full extent (the use of third-party components, libraries, and frameworks should be justified in the Readme of your project)
* paying attention to code organization and project structure (feel free to use our [code style](https://github.com/surfstudio/SwiftCodestyle)))
* treating your project code as a part of a larger project and not a small local app
