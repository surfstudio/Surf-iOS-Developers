# To aspiring developers

## Trainee program at Surf

Start your career in IT at Surf. If you already have some work experience and you’re willing to grow in the field you’ve chosen — join our team!

During the 2-3 months trainee period, you will be supervised by an experienced mentor. By the end of it, you will have gained experience working on a real-life project and a chance to get a full-time offer.

### What do you need to do?

To become a trainee, you need to:
1. Send a letter to job@surfstudio.ru giving a brief description of your experience and saying you’d like to become a trainee
2. Do a decent job of writing your test project
3. Successfully pass the interview with our HR and head of department

[Here](students-test-project.md) you’ll find the technical specifications for the test project.

## What is the program like?

- Onboarding into the company. We’ll get you familiar with the basic procedures: where to refer to when having problems, how to track your working hours, and what in-house regulations we have. We’ll also grant you permission to access the main services we use at work.
- Test project. We’ll help you do your iOS project in accordance with the best practices and under the supervision of our mentors.
- Real-life project. We’ll help you blend into your team and start doing real-life tasks on a fully functional project.

## Materials

If you’ve only just started your way in iOS development, feel free to check out our selection of [learning resources for trainees](students-material.md) (and more).

If you want to map out your education several steps ahead, try looking for a “roadmap of an ios developer” on the internet. In our opinion, you’ll find the most interesting ones:
- in one of the GitHub repositories named [iOS-Developer-Roadmap](https://github.com/BohdanOrlov/iOS-Developer-Roadmap);
- and in [one of the blogs](https://artyom.space/swift-roadmap/#swift) on the internet.

You can also find some [projects to get your creative juices flowing](https://github.com/surfstudio/iOSSpringSchool2020/blob/master/practice.md#%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B) and boost your skills on the page of one of our summer schools.
