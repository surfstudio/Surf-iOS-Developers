# Recruitment and onboarding at Surf step by step

We are always on the lookout for new talents. Your level doesn’t matter: there always are engaging tasks and new challenges for both beginners and hyper-experienced developers.

If you want to join Surf, tell us a bit about yourself and send an email to job@surfstudio.ru.

## Recruitment

- Step 1: a talk with a recruiter. She or he will ask you about your experience, achievements, and expectations from the new employer.
- Step 2: screening. It involves five quick questions the aim of which is to get an understanding of your technical background and ability to provide reasons for your choices when solving unusual problems.
- Step 3: candidate evaluation. We decide whether or not to reach out to a candidate based on the screening. We’d also welcome you showing your code on GitHub or doing our [test project](test-project.md), but that’s not necessary.
- Step 4: technical interview. We won’t go deep into the way a system or a language works: instead, we’ll talk to you to form a view of your visual experience, preferences and methods of work, your ability to think and make decisions as well as evaluate your teamwork skills.
- Step 5: within a few days, our recruiter will let you know the results.

If they are good and you accept the offer, you should be looking forward to onboarding.

## Onboarding

We make it comfortable so that you quickly get adapted. Here’s where we show you the ropes within our company, your department, and your team.

- Step 1: onboarding into the company. We’ll get you familiar with the basic procedures: where to refer to when having problems, how to track your working hours, and what in-house regulations we have. We’ll also grant you permission to access the main services we use at work.
- Step 2: onboarding into your department. We’ll give you a small test project under the supervision of a mentor: that will help you get accustomed to the code style, methods, and infrastructure.
- Step 3: onboarding into your team. Under the guidance of your mentor, you will start working on a real-life project where you will actually spend the rest of your probation period.
